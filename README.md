   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gandeeee/Company-Profile-Project.git
   ```

2. **Enter the project directory**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Open in your browser**  
   Double-click `index.html` or drag it into a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

> Optional: For a local server (better for history/SPA behavior), you can run any static server, e.g.:
> ```bash
> # Python 3
> python -m http.server 8080
> # then visit http://localhost:8080
> ```
