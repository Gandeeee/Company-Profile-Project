This repository was created to house the source code for the official corporate profile website of **PT. Kinarya Agung Prima**. I developed this project as a single-page application (SPA) to elegantly and modernly showcase the company's identity, services, and portfolio. The website was built entirely from scratch to provide a unique and responsive user experience across all devices.

## üìú Project Description

**PT. Kinarya Agung Prima** is a trusted partner offering comprehensive solutions across three main pillars:
1.  **MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) Organizer**
2.  **Professional Training & Certification**
3.  **General Supplier & Procurement**

This website serves as a digital showcase, presenting detailed information about each service, the company's core values, organizational structure, and a gallery of successfully completed projects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Fully Responsive Design**: Optimal viewing experience on all devices, from desktops and tablets to smartphones.
* **Glassmorphism Navigation**: A modern and interactive "glass" effect navbar that changes its color and shape as the user scrolls.
* **Interactive Gallery**: A dynamic photo gallery system with nested folders (categories and albums), complete with a lightbox for an immersive viewing experience.
* **Smooth Animations & Transitions**: Subtle hover effects and transitions on various elements to enhance the visual experience.
* **Logical Content Structure**: Clear section divisions‚Äîfrom the company profile, services, and values to the contact information‚Äîmaking it easy for visitors to find what they need.
* **Framework-Free**: Built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies for lightweight performance and maximum design freedom.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

This project was built with a focus on performance and custom design, using standard web technologies without relying on external frameworks like Bootstrap or JQuery.

        * **CSS Variables**: For efficient and consistent theme color management.
        * **Media Queries**: To ensure an adaptive design across various screen sizes.
